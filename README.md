👋 Hi, I’m @ianwcz

- 👀 I’m interested in AI, machine learning, chatbot development, and big data applications. Also diving into web development, process automation, and creating proof-of-concept projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multi-agent systems, advanced Fedora setup (Fedora 41), and Termux for coding on the go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative AI projects, business intelligence applications, and sophisticated data analysis tools. Open to building multi-platform applications and virtual assistants!
