👋 Hi, I’m @ianwcz

- 👀 I’m interested in AI, machine learning, chatbot development, and big data applications. Also diving into web development, process automation, and creating proof-of-concept projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multi-agent systems, advanced Fedora setup (Fedora 41), and Termux for coding on the go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative AI projects, business intelligence applications, and sophisticated data analysis tools. Open to building multi-platform applications and virtual assistants!
- 📫 How to reach me: wiesner@amarox.cz
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a chatbot in a week without previous programming knowledge – all prompts were my own, but AI did the coding!
